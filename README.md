# Visualisation_Using_PowerBI

Data visualization is important for almost every career. It can be used by teachers to display
student test results, by computer scientists exploring advancements in artificial intelligence
(AI) or by executives looking to share information with stakeholders. It also plays an important
role in big data projects.
Here we are using PowerBI for Data-Visualisatoin.
In PowerBi we can create visualization in two ways. First is by adding from the right side
panel to Report Canvas. By default, it is the table type visualization, which is selected in
Power BI. Another way is to drag the fields from right side bar to the axis and value axis under
Visualization.
In PowerBI, it is also possible to move the visualizations on the reporting canvas by clicking and
dragging it. We can also switch between different type of charts and visualizations from the 
visualization panel. It attempts to convert the selected fields to the new visual type as closely as
possible.
